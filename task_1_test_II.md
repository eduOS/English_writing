These days, it seems that an increasing number of people are leaving rural areas to live in the city.

Discuss some of the **effects of rural depopulation** (migration from the country to the city) and suggest some ways in which this trend could be **reversed**. 

## my assignment
It is said that the city is our greatest invention. A growing number of people come from rural areas are attracted by this creation and are marching towards big cities. As a result, there has been a progressive decrease in population every year in country. Rural depopulation may have essential bad effects on city and rural development and may cause human resource waste. To alleviate this problem, the government could do more on investment and talent introduction.
