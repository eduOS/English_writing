These days, it seems that an increasing number of people are leaving rural areas to live in the city.

Discuss some of the **effects of rural depopulation** (migration from the country to the city) and suggest some ways in which this trend could be **reversed**. 

## my assignment
It is said that the city is our greatest invention. A growing number of people come from rural areas are attracted by this creation and are marching towards big cities. As a result, there has been a progressive decrease in population every year in country. Rural depopulation may have essential bad effects on city and rural development and may cause resource waste. To alleviate this problem, the government could do more control on investment and talent introduction.      

The uncontrollable increase of city population and the decrease of rural population may depress both the urban and the rural development. More people may casue more polution and more unemployment matters. With the increase of the unemployment rate, crime issue may become serious. Thus, people's living and working condition would be worse. However, in undeveloped places, because of the lose of labor force caused by depopulation and the accompanying high price work force businesss can be hardly done. Unprofitable business may result in undeveloped resources in these place. Without any doubt, people living there can hardly live a better life. Thus, more and more people may continue to migrate to cities. Apart from development problem, resource including the human resource and the mentioned natural resource may become a Heartbreaking wate. Those migrant who can never find a job and who are underemployed very much in metropolis maybe can make a big difference in their hometown with unique resources there.         

It is a country problem and only the governments, national government and local governments, have the ability to deal this issue. First of all, more money should be invested into remote places with develope potential. Education system and other infrastructures can only be improved with enough financial support. If a well business condition is built, people would be attracted to come back. Secondly, governmetn would make some benefits to those talented people who are doing well in city to attracte them go back. A splendid mind usually can make a successful plant and a successful company would gether thousants of people.

In conclusion, the outflow of rural population would affect both the city and the country's development. The governments all over the world can do something to make a change.
