## task
These days, it seems that an increasing number of people are leaving rural areas to live in the city.

Discuss some of the **effects of rural depopulation** (migration from the country to the city) and suggest some ways in which this trend could be **reversed**. 

## my assignment
It's said that the city is our greatest invention. Nowadays, a growing number of people from rural areas are attracted by this creation and are marching towards big cities. As a result, there has been a progressive decrease in population every year in the population outside of cities. Inevitably, rural depopulation has brought about some bad effects such as impact on development and resource waste. To alleviate this problem, the government could  invest more in rural areas and add educational opportunities there.      

The uncontrollable increase of city population and the decrease of rural population may depress the development of both urban and rural areas. A larger population in cities may cause more pollution and raise the unemployment rate. With the increase of the unemployment rate, crime may become a more serious issue. Thus, people's living and working condition  could get worse. However, in undeveloped places, because of the loss of labor force caused by depopulation and the accompanying high price of the remaining workforce, business can be hardly done. Unprofitable business may result in undeveloped resources in these places. Without any doubt, people living there can hardly live a better life. Thus, more and more people continue to migrate to cities. Apart from development problem, resources including the human resource and natural resources may be wasted for no reason. Those migrants who can never find a job and who are mostly underemployed in large cities might be able to make a big difference in their hometown with the unique resources present there.         

It is a problem with rural areas and only the governments, both the national government and local governments, have the ability to deal this issue. First of all, more money should be invested into remote places with development potential. The education system and other infrastructure can only be improved with enough financial support. If a  good business environment is built, people could be attracted to come back. Secondly,  the government could provide some incentives to those talented people who are doing well in city to attract them to return to the country. A splendid mind usually can make a successful  factory, and a successful company would gather thousands of people.

In conclusion, the outflow of rural population  will affect the development of both the city and rural areas. Governments all over the world can do something to make a change.
