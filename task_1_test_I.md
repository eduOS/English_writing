The two **line graphs** **illustrate** the growing amount of defense expenditure and its **proportion** of GNP in America.  
  
It can be seen from the left line graph that America increased their spending on defence in fluctuation over the 20 years. In 1956 the amount of spending on defence stood at 37 million dollar. By 1963 this number increased gradually to 50, but in the next year the spending saw an opposite trend from 50 to 45 billion dollar. After that, the figure rose dramatically over the next 5 years, peaking at 80 in around 1969. After 1969, the figure fell again. The period from 1971 to 1974 experienced a slight rise, but the amount of spending declined again. In the later two years, the amount showed an upward trend, overtaking that of spending in 1969.   
  
As we can see from the second line graph, opposite to the first graph the defense spending proportion of GNP in America decreased in fluctuation over that period. The rate of defence spending in 1956 was relatively hight at about 10 percent of the GNP. By 1963 this number decreased graducally to 8 percent, but bounced back to above 9 percent in 1968. Then the percentage dropped continuously by more than 30% over the 8 years between 1968 and 1976, with the percentage reaching below 6 percent. 
  
The elephant in the room for the viewers, of course, is defence spending of America doubled over the 20 years while its proportion  of GNP almost halved.
